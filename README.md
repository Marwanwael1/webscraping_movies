# Movie Ranking Scraper

This Python script fetches data on the top 50 most highly-ranked films from a designated webpage. The script displays the extracted data in the console, saves it to a CSV file named `top_50_films.csv`, and stores it in a SQLite database (`Movies.db`) under a table called `Top_50`.
